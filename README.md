Add the data to your google drive as mentioned in the report/notebook or link to the file path, I have also included the .py and .pynb of the Google Colab notebook.

iv: Abstract
In 2023 there are many e-commerce companies that use data for forecasting. Using 
tools to forecast inventory and sales is something companies are happy to invest 
money in as it would improve profits (Abeysekara and Rupasinghe, 2019). Forecasting 
does this by reducing overstocking as there is a cost to store goods, paired with 
reducing the amount of stock that would pass its sell-by date, it also reduces 
understocking inventory which leads to unhappy customers and loss of sales. (Puneet 
et al, 2021). 

The methodology involves data integration, cleaning, analysing, and applying machine 
learning algorithms to the data, both regression and market basket analysis algorithms
were used. This was done using the Python programming language on Google Colab., 
a guide to embed Chat GPT was added to allow users to learn Python.
The result is a cleaned data set, informative visualisation, machine learning 
algorithms, and a chatbot. All on an evolvable interface that small businesses could 
use to their needs. Linear regression proved to be a good model and the forecasting 
was accurate. Upon completing the prototype, it was clear the data industry requires 
expertise, cash, and time to develop functional products such as Tableau and Looker.
